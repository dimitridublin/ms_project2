## Project: MS Project 2 - Build an Interactive Travel Website (June 2021)

### Booterstown Travel - The European City Breaks Specialists
[View the live website here](https://dimitridublin.github.io/ms_project2/)

For my second Milestone Project I chose to build an interactive website for an imaginary travel agency, based in Booterstown, Co Dublin (i.e. project idea 1 in the 
course assessment handbook). 

#### User Stories
As a prospective client I want to find the best city break destination for my needs: read information about different cities that are potential holiday 
destinations and review city maps with relevant attractions, accommodation and restaurants clearly marked (in order to estimate suitability of accommodation on offer in relation to city's sights and restaurants of interest). I would also like to view photos to get an indication of 
each destination's beauty, major attractions, food choices and accommodation available. Easy to access links of the travel agency's social media pages would also be welcome as they
can provide additional info on both the city breaks offered as well as the agency's reputation and previous customer experience through client submitted reviews.

As the site owner I want to get users to book a city break from this site. For this purpose, I want to display information about 
the different cities my agency offers holiday breaks to, and allow users to get a feeling of the attractions, accommodation and restaurants each destination offers.
I also want to have enticing photographs and easy enquiry and booking facilities to provide additional motivation to prospective clients to book a package directly from my 
website. Finally, I want to highlight the excellent value and location suitability of accommodation my city break packages include.

#### Features
##### Existing Features
* Website built with a "mobile-first" approach to maximise positivity of user experience.
* Header, navigation and footer maintain their style across website to provide a smooth navigating experience for users. 
* Navigation section reduces to a hamburger menu in smaller screen sizes and company slogan appears only on bigger screen sizes. This is to ensure a "clutter-free" screen navigation experience irrespective of user's screen size. 
* Company logo on top left of each page also functions as a navigation link back to the homepage.
* A link to the booking page was included in the navigation section so that users are only one click away from the booking page at all times. 
* On top of booking page itself, the company price promise displays prominently and unambiguously to reassure users that irrespective of the package they choose they can have peace of mind the deal they are getting is the best on the market.
* Below the company's price promise users are presented with a booking menu in order to preselect their criteria for the packages website should display to them. This functionality was not further developed as a) it was outside the scope of this project, and b) it required a database of actual accommodation packages which BTT as an imaginary company does not have.
* 
* 
* where a "buy now" button would take user directly to the online payment page (payment page not developed as it was outside the scope of this project). This allows user reaching the online payment page in a maximum of two steps/clicks from anywhere on the website thus maximising user experience and achieving the respective site owner's requirement. 
* Homepage provides a "teaser" of up to four photos (depending on screen size) that showcase the establishment's excellent facilities, further enticing users to visit the gallery page for additional motivation to sign-up and/or attend.
* A page dedicated to the organised classes schedule, as required by both prospective and current members.
* Photo gallery showcasing the club's facilities as well as people using such in order to inform and create interest for potential members to join, and to motivate current members to attend.
* A contact page with a FAQs section and a contact form in case query not covered by FAQs, giving clients the option to submit their questions online (in case they prefer such). Giving users the option to phone, email, write, contact through social media or using the online form (and being able to review the business' private policy before committing to such) offers clients an enhanced user experience.
* A Google map iframe (in the contact page), which enhances user experience by allowing clients to connect to Google Maps' functionalities in terms of accessing the location as well as obtaining info on the nearby amenities.
* Footer provides a concise guide to the establishment's opening hours, location, public transport info, social media links and contact details. As such, user experience is further enhanced as their requirements are easily met from any web page.
