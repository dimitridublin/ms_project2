## Project: MS Project 2 - Build an Interactive Travel Website (June 2021)

### Booterstown Travel - The City Break Specialists
[View the live website here](https://dimitridublin.github.io/ms_project2/)

For my second Milestone Project I chose to build an interactive website for an imaginary travel agency, based in Booterstown, Co Dublin (i.e. project idea 1 in the 
course assessment handbook). 

#### User Stories
As a prospective client I want to find the best city break destination for my needs: read information about different cities that are potential holiday 
destinations and review city maps with relevant attractions, accommodation and restaurants clearly marked. I would also like to view photos to get an indication of 
each destination's beauty, major attractions and accommodation available. Easy to access links of the travel agency's social media pages would also be welcome as they
can provide additional info on both the city breaks offered as well as the agency's reputation and previous customer experience through client submitted reviews.

As the site owner I want to get users to choose a travel package from this site and/or from its sponsors. For this purpose, I want to display information about 
the different cities my agency offers holiday breaks to, and allow users to get a feeling of the attractions, accommodation and restaurants each destination offers.
I also want to have enticing photographs and easy booking facilities to provide additional motivation to prospective clients to book a package directly from my 
website. Finally, I want to highlight the excellent value and location of accommodation my city break packages include.
